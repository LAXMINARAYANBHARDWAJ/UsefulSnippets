# Useful Python Snippets

A collection of small, miscellaneous Python programs and scripts.  
Some are practical utilities, some are quirky experiments — all are shared openly under the MIT License for anyone who finds them useful.  
(There might be some C++ programs too :)

## Features
- Lightweight, no unnecessary dependencies
- Each script solves a specific problem
- Easy to adapt and extend

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and run any script directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LAXMINARAYANBHARDWAJ/MiscPythonPrograms.git
cd MiscPythonPrograms
python3 script_name.py
